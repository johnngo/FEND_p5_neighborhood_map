# in this project

We use **knockout js framework to handle the updates in the list view and search filter
We use **google maps api to display the map along with markers that corresponds with each location in the list item. By clicking the marker, it triggers an animation and an infowindow to display the detail of the location
Lastly, we use **yelp api to request data from Yelp, it's used to display additional information about the location, for example, rating and address.
